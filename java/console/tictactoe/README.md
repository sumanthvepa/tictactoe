# Build and Installation Notes

## Notes on Packaging the Java Console app

To build an executable installer for the java console app run the following command
in java/console/tictactoe. This needs to be run on a Windows machine.

```
jpackage @windows.jpack
```

This assumes that you have jpackage and its dependencies have already been installed.
